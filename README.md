# AAPL Forecasting Model

### [Jupyter Notebook] ()

### [Report] ()

## Description

Five different techniques were explored: linear regression, a 12-month moving average, integrated moving average (IMA), ARIMA, and STL decomposition followed by ARIMA on residuals. Each model provided a forecast through 2029 based on historical trends and assumptions. Each approach was evaluated to determine how well it captured AAPL's past movements and provided plausible projections by comparing outputs to actual backtested data.

Analysis was done in Python, using libraries such as yfinance for data gathering, pandas for data manipulation, numpy for fast calculations, sklearn for model creation, and matplotlib for visualization.
